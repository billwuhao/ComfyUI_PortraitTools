## Model Download

If you are using the [ComfyUI-ReActor](https://github.com/Gourieff/comfyui-reactor) and [ComfyUI-RMBG](https://github.com/1038lab/ComfyUI-RMBG) nodes, you do not need to download the models, as they are shared.

Otherwise, download [detection_Resnet50_Final.pth](https://huggingface.co/salmonrk/facedetection/blob/main/detection_Resnet50_Final.pth) and place it in the `ComfyUI\models\facedetection` folder. The models for [ComfyUI-RMBG](https://github.com/1038lab/ComfyUI-RMBG) will be automatically downloaded to the `ComfyUI\models\RMBG` folder.
